Algorithm: Let X and Y be two categorical variables with finite
cardinalities |X| and |Y|. We observe a set of pairs {xi, yi} drawn
IID from the joint distribution of X and Y. The basic idea behind CODE
and related methods is to represent (embed) each value of X and each
value of Y as points in a common low dimensional Euclidean space such
that values that frequently co-occur lie close to each other. S-CODE
further restricts these points to lie on the unit sphere. Please see
the following papers for a description.
